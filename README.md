# balancing_ball

This is a 48h* speed project with the goal: 
* Create a deivce that holds a ball in the center of the plate.
* Use OpenCV to track the ball and use the RaspberryPi to control motors to move the plate
* The most parts must created by a 3D Printer
* Use no other pre-made objects and parts




( *  the printing-time is not included, becuase my printer is really really slow :D)
